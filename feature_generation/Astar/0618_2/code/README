	This README contains brief description about the functionality 
	of each code under this folder.

	trans_feature1:
		(1) Read PaperAuthor.my
		(2) Given an Paper Id in PaperAuthor.my, calculate the
			number of Author who wrote this Paper Id, and write
			to ../features/paper.authornum 
		(3) Given an Author Id in PaperAuthor.my, calculate the 
			number of Paper wriiten by this Author Id, and write 
			to ../features/author.papernum 

	trans_feature3:
		(1) Read PaperAuthor.my, Paper.my
		(2) Given an Author Id in PaperAuthor.my, list all of 
			the conference Id associated with the papers written
			by this Author Id, and write to 
			../features/author.conferencelist
		(3) Given an Author Id in PaperAuthor.my, list all of 
			the Journal Id associated with the papers written
			by this Author Id, and write to 
			../features/author.journallist

	trans_feature4:
		(1) Read PaperAuthor.my
		(2) Given an Paper Id in PaperAuthor.my, list all of 
			the Author Id who wrote this Paper Id, and write 
			to ../features/paper.authorlist
		(3) Given an Author Id in PaperAuthor.my, list all of
			the Paper Id written by this Author Id, and write
			to ../features/author.paperlist

	trans_feature6:
		(1) Read PaperAuthor.my, PaperYear.my
		(2) Given an Paper Id, write the paper's year to 
			../features/paper.year
		(3) Given an Author Id, record the earliest year
			among all Paper Id written by this Author Id,
			and write to ../feature/author.yearstart
		(4) Given an Author Id, record the latest year
			among all Paper Id written by this Paper Id,
			and write to ../feature/author.yearend

	trans_feature7:
		(1) Read paper.authorlist, paper.authorlist
		(2) Given an Author Id in PaperAuthor.my, 
			calculate the number coauthor of this Author 
			Id, and write to ../features/author.coauthornum
		(3) Guven an Author Id in PaperAuthor.my,
			list all the coauthor of this Author Id,
			and write to ../features/author.coauthorlist

	make_feature:
		Making 11 features based on the above 
		preprocessing files. Features are listed below
		(1) Number of paper of a given Author Id
		(2) Earliest year of paper of a given Author Id
		(3) Latest year of paper of a given Author Id
		(4) Number of coauthor of a given Author Id
		(5) Number of author of a given Paper Id
		(6) Year of a given Paper Id
		(7) Given an (P_i,A_j) pair, count the number
			of conference Id associated with paper Id
			written by A_j which is same as P_i's
			conference Id ( A_j - P - C id - P_i )
		(8) Given an (P_i,A_j) pair, count the numer 
			of journal Id assocaited with paper Id
			written by A_j which is same as P_i's 
			journal Id ( A_j - P - J id - P_i )
		(9) Given an (P_i,A_j) pair, count the number 
			of coauthor excluding A_j itself
		(10) Given an (P_i,A_j) pair, count the number 
			of PAPA path (P_i - A - P - A_j )
		(11) Given an (P_i,A_j) pair, calculate the 
			ratio of valid PAPA cnt

	make_feature1:
		Making 2 features based in the above 
		preprocessing files. Features are listed below
		(12) PAPA Cnt similar to (10), excluding A_j
			itself
		(13) PAPA ratio similar to (11), excluding A_j
			itself

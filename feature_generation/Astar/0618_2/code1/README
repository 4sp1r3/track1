This README contains brief description about the functionality 
of each code under this folder.

strcmp95.c:
	(1) The strcmp95 function returns a double precision value
		from 0.0 (total disagreement) to 1.0 (char-by-char agree).
		The return value is a measure of the similarity of the 
		two strings. This similarity is also called Jaro-Winkler 
		distance
	(2) This code is download from 
		http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/SCW/Text-JaroWinkler-0.1/strcmp95.c

trans_feature1:
	(1) Given a (P_i,A_j) pair, calculate the number of 
		duplicated (P_i,A_j) pair in PaperAuthor.csv. 
	(2) Given a (P_i,A_j) pair, calculate the max Jaro-
		Winker distance of (\bar{A},A_j} in terms of full
		name. \bar{A} is the coauthor of A_j, excluding 
		A_j itself.
	(3) Given a (P_i,A_j) pair, calculate the max Jaro-
		Winker distance of (\bar{A},A_j} in terms of last
		name. \bar{A} is the coauthor of A_j, excluding 
		A_j itself. We obtain the last name simply by taking
		the last word in full name

trans_feature2:
	(1) Given a (P_i,A_j) pair, count the number of 
		PAP path ( P_i - A_j - P )
